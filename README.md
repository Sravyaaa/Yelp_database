# Yelp_database

As a newly onboarded Data Engineer at Yelp, my primary responsibility involves designing a relational database optimized for experimentation with advanced machine learning tools. This database mirrors the structure of Yelp’s main production environment but includes only a curated subset of the full dataset.

In addition to setting up the database, I’ve developed comprehensive documentation, including a data dictionary and an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), to provide clear insights into the database schema for the data science team.

Furthermore, I contributed analytical insights by addressing specific queries related to the project and supported the findings with visualizations through graphs and other visual tools to enhance understanding and decision-making.
